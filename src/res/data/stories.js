        We create a small team helper on Discord in 12 hours and I was responsible for the backend development and system design.
        I used the NGINX for the load balancing and API gateway, used the Directus for the backend server to connect the Postgres database and used Redis as the cache.

          Artificial Intelligence Practice Project - Connect 4 Game
        </h4>
        The Project is a part of the Artificial Intelligence Practice when I was a sophomore.
        I used max-min algorithm to implement the AI player. So we can control the difficulty of the game by changing the depth of the search tree, so if you beat the AI, the AI will be smarter.
        In this project, I also implemented the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to improve the efficiency of the search tree with multi-processing.
